There are a few other variables that the system sets for you to use as well.

- $0 - The name of the Bash script.
- $1 - $9 - The first 9 arguments to the Bash script. (As mentioned above.)
- $# - How many arguments were passed to the Bash script.
- $@ - All the arguments supplied to the Bash script.
- $? - The exit status of the most recently run process.
- $$ - The process ID of the current script.
- $USER - The username of the user running the script.
- $HOSTNAME - The hostname of the machine the script is running on.
- $SECONDS - The number of seconds since the script was started.
- $RANDOM - Returns a different random number each time is it referred to.
- $LINENO - Returns the current line number in the Bash script.

```

```

The first, second, etc command line arguments to the script.

```
**variable=value**
```

```
**Quotes " '**
```

Double will do variable substitution, single will not.

```
**variable=$( command )**
```

Save the output of a command into a variable

```
**export var1**
```

Make the variable var1 available to child processes.

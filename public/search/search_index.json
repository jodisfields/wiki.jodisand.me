On the other hand, a plain text file, which contains Python code that is designed to be imported and used from another Python file, is called module.

Python is also a piece of software called an interpreter. The interpreter is the program you\u2019ll need to run Python code and scripts. Technically, the interpreter is a layer of software that works between your program and your computer hardware to get your code running. Depending on the Python implementation you use, the interpreter can be:</p> <ul> <li>A program written in C, like CPython, which is the core implementation of the language</li> <li>A program written in Java, like Jython</li> <li>A program written in Python itself, like PyPy</li> <li>A program implemented in .NET, like IronPython</li> </ul> <p>Whatever form the interpreter takes, the code you write will always be run by this program. Therefore, the first condition to be able to run Python scripts is to have the interpreter correctly installed on your system.</p> <p>The interpreter is able to run Python code in two different ways:</p> <ul> <li>As a script or module</li> <li>As a piece of code typed into an interactive session</li> </ul>"},{"location":"network_automation/#how-does-the-interpreter-work","title":"How Does the Interpreter Work?","text":"<p>When you try to run Python scripts, a multi-step process begins.

Its purpose is to optimize code execution.

The PVM is the runtime engine of Python. It is a cycle that iterates over the instructions of your bytecode to run them one by one.</p> <p>The PVM is not an isolated component of Python. It\u2019s just part of the Python system you\u2019ve installed on your machine. Technically, the PVM is the last step of what is called the Python interpreter.

This option may not be widely used in the development stage, but it may be used when you release your code for production.</p> <p>In order to be able to run your scripts with a double-click, you must satisfy some conditions that will depend on your operating system. Windows, for example, associates the extensions .py and .pyw with the programs python.exe and pythonw.exe respectively. This allows you to run your scripts by double-clicking on them.</p> <p>When you have a script with a command-line interface, it is likely that you only see the flash of a black window on your screen. To avoid this annoying situation, you can add a statement like input<code>('Press Enter to Continue...')</code> at the end of the script. This way, the program will stop until you press Enter.</p> <p>This trick has its drawbacks, though. For example, if your script has any error, the execution will be aborted before reaching the input() statement, and you still won\u2019t be able to see the result.</p> <p>On Unix-like systems, you\u2019ll probably be able to run your scripts by double-clicking on them in your file manager. To achieve this, your script must have execution permissions, and you\u2019ll need to use the shebang trick you\u2019ve already seen. Likewise, you may not see any results on screen when it comes to command-line interface scripts.</p> <p>Because the execution of scripts through double-click has several limitations and depends on many factors (such as the operating system, the file manager, execution permissions, file associations), it is recommended that you see it as a viable option for scripts already debugged and ready to go into production.</p>"}]}

# zip

The command is tottally compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems). The zip command is pretty good for packaging a set of files for distribution and/or for archiving files; and for saving disk space by temporarily compressing unused files or directories.

Simple Examples

The syntax is as follows:

```
zip file.zip file1.txt file2.doc photo.jpg ```

To zip resume.doc and all *.c file, enter:
```
zip bacup.zip resume.doc *.c
```

To zip data directory, enter:
```
zip -r backup.zip data
```

Ctrl + p : same as Up arrow. Ctrl + r : begins a backward search through command history. ( keep pressing Ctrl + r to move backward ) Ctrl + s : to stop output to terminal. Ctrl + q : to resume output to terminal after Ctrl + s. Ctrl + a : move to the beginning of line. Ctrl + e : move to the end of line. Ctrl + d : if you ' ve type something, Ctrl + d deletes the character under the cursor, else , it escapes the current shell. Ctrl + k : delete all text from the cursor to the end of line. Ctrl + x + backspace : delete all text from the beginning of line to the cursor. Ctrl + t : transpose the character before the cursor with the one under the cursor, press Esc + t to transposes the two words before the cursor. Ctrl + w : cut the word before the cursor ; then Ctrl + y paste it Ctrl + u : cut the line before the cursor ; then Ctrl + y paste it Ctrl + _ : undo typing. Ctrl + l : equivalent to clear. Ctrl + x + Ctrl + e : launch editor defined by $EDITOR to input your command. Useful for multi-line commands. Change case Esc + u # converts text from cursor to the end of the word to uppercase. Esc + l # converts text from cursor to the end of the word to lowercase. Esc + c # converts letter under the cursor to uppercase, rest of the word to lowercase. Run history number (e.g. 53) !53 Run last command !! # run the previous command using sudo sudo !!

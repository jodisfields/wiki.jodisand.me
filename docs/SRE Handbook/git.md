**HEAD**: the current commit your repo is on. Most of the time HEAD points to the latest commit in your branch, but that doesn't have to be the case. HEAD really just means "what is my repo currently pointing at". Thanks svick for the heads up on this one (no pun intended)

In the event that the commit HEAD refers to is not the tip of any branch, this is called a "detached head".

**master**: The name of the default branch that git creates for you when first creating a repo. In most cases, "master" means "the main branch". Most shops have everyone pushing to master, and master is considered the definitive view of the repo. But it's also common for release branches to be made off of master for releasing. Your local repo has its own master branch, that almost always follows the master of a remote repo.

**origin**: The default name that git gives to your main remote repo. Your box has its own repo, and you most likely push out to some remote repo that you and all your coworkers push to. That remote repo is almost always called origin, but it doesn't have to be.

HEAD is an official notion in git, HEAD always has a well defined meaning. master and origin are common names usually used in git but they don't have to be.

**INSTALL GIT**

GitHub provides desktop clients that include a graphical user
interface for the most common repository actions and an automatically
updating command line edition of Git for advanced scenarios.

**GitHub for Windows**

htps://windows.github.com

**GitHub for Mac**

htps://mac.github.com

Git distributions for Linux and POSIX systems are available on the
official Git SCM web site.

**Git for All Platforms**

htp://git-scm.com

**CONFIGURE TOOLING**
Configure user information for all local repositories

`$ git config --global user.name "[name]"`

Sets the name you want atached to your commit transactions

`$ git config --global user.email "[email address]"`

Sets the email you want atached to your commit transactions

`$ git config --global color.ui auto`

Enables helpful colorization of command line output

**CREATE REPOSITORIES**
Start a new repository or obtain one from an existing URL

`$ git init [project-name]`

Creates a new local repository with the specified name

`$ git clone [url]`

Downloads a project and its entire version history

**MAKE CHANGES**
Review edits and craf a commit transaction

`$ git status`

Lists all new or modified files to be commited

`$ git add [file]`

Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning

`$ git reset [file]`

Unstages the file, but preserve its contents

`$ git diff`

Shows file differences not yet staged

`$ git diff --staged`

Shows file differences between staging and the last file version

`$ git commit -m "[descriptive message]"`

Records file snapshots permanently in version history

**GROUP CHANGES**
Name a series of commits and combine completed efforts

`$ git branch`

Lists all local branches in the current repository

`$ git branch [branch-name]`

Creates a new branch

`$ git checkout [branch-name]`

Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory

`$ git merge [branch]`

Combines the specified branch’s history into the current branch

`$ git branch -d [branch-name]`

Deletes the specified branch

**REFACTOR FILENAMES**

Relocate and remove versioned files

`$ git rm [file]`

Deletes the file from the working directory and stages the deletion

`$ git rm --cached [file]`

Removes the file from version control but preserves the file locally

`$ git mv [file-original] [file-renamed]`

Changes the file name and prepares it for commit

**SUPPRESS TRACKING**
Exclude temporary files and paths

`$ git ls-files --other --ignored --exclude-standard`

Lists all ignored files in this project

```
*.log
build/
temp-*
```

A text file named .gitignore suppresses accidental versioning of files and paths matching the specified paterns

**SAVE FRAGMENTS**

Shelve and restore incomplete changes

`$ git stash`

Temporarily stores all modified tracked files

`$ git stash list`

Lists all stashed changesets

`$ git stash pop`

Restores the most recently stashed files

`$ git stash drop`

Discards the most recently stashed changeset

**REVIEW HISTORY**

Browse and inspect the evolution of project files

`$ git log`

Lists version history for the current branch

`$ git log --follow [file]`

Lists version history for a file, including renames

`$ git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]`

Shows content differences between two branches

`$ git show [commit]`

Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit

**REDO COMMITS**

Erase mistakes and craf replacement history

`$ git reset [commit]`

Undoes all commits afer [commit], preserving changes locally

`$ git reset --hard [commit]`

Discards all history and changes back to the specified commit

**SYNCHRONIZE CHANGES**

Register a repository bookmark and exchange version history

`$ git fetch [bookmark]`

Downloads all history from the repository bookmark

`$ git merge [bookmark]/[branch]`

Combines bookmark’s branch into current local branch

`$ git push [alias] [branch]`

Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub

`$ git pull`

Downloads bookmark history and incorporates changes

`git pull --rebase <remote>`

Fetch the specified remote’s copy of the current branch and immediately merge it into the local copy. This is the same as git fetch <remote> followed by git merge origin/<current-branch>.
Same as the above command, but instead of using git merge to integrate the remote branch with the local one, use git rebase.

Examples
The following example demonstrates how to synchronize with the central repository's master branch:

```
git checkout master
git pull --rebase origin
```

This simply moves your local changes onto the top of what everybody else has already contributed.

Examples
The following example describes one of the standard methods for publishing local contributions to the central repository. First, it makes sure your local master is up-to-date by fetching the central repository’s copy and rebasing your changes on top of them. The interactive rebase is also a good opportunity to clean up your commits before sharing them. Then, the git push command sends all of the commits on your local master to the central repository.

```
git checkout master
git fetch origin master
git rebase -i origin/master
# Squash commits, fix up commit messages etc.
git push origin master
```

Since we already made sure the local master was up-to-date, this should result in a fast-forward merge, and git push should not complain about any of the non-fast-forward issues discussed above.
